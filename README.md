This  paper  indicates  a  comprehensive  analysis  ofResidual Network architecture for better and efficient optimiza-tion.  Our  main  aim  was  not  focused  on  better  accuracy  ratherour   goal   was   to   design   a   recommendation   system   that   caneasily  rank  a  network  from  best  to  worst  case  for  a  betterefficient network performance. In quest of achieving our objectiveseveral activation function, depth-width and several connectionsof a ResNet structure was investigated. Finally, a comprehensiverecommendation  was  delivered,  which  even  has  the  scope  offurther improvement. For this paper, only two types of activationfunction was tested, but in future, it is possible to make a databasebased  on  the  user  recommendation  and  preference.  A  note-able  finding  from  our  research  included  that  increasing  widthenhanced  the  testing  accuracy  significantly  while  an  incrementin  depth  did  not  have  any  substantial  effect.  This  discrepancywas  not  expected  and  in  future,  it  is  conceivable  that  properregularization mechanism could possibly enhance the bottleneck.Moreover, it is noteworthy that, our goal of this project was noton  comparing  our  results  with  state  of  the  art  accuracy  results,rather,  we  focused  on  a  novel  recommendation  based  approachfor  the  future  ease  for  a  particular  data-set  for  researchers
